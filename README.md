# Training_Bank

A mock banking application demonstrating cloud-native development patterns using free-tier services for learning scalable banking system architecture.

## Project Overview

We are creating a mock banking app using the following tech stack:
- **.NET 8** (backend with Kestrel web server)
- **Angular** (frontend with Node.js 20)
- **Docker** (containerization with multi-stage builds)
- **Kubernetes** (container orchestration with AKS)
- **Azure** (cloud hosting with free tier services)
- **GitHub** (repository, container registry, and CI/CD)

**Requirement:** All services must be free to use for learning scalable banking system architecture.

**Key Architecture Features:**
- **Multi-architecture container builds** (AMD64/ARM64 compatibility)
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication** for secure GitHub Actions → Azure integration
- **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** for private container image storage
- **VS Code dev containers** for consistent development environments
- **Automated CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Visual Studio Code** with Dev Containers extension
- **Docker Desktop** running on host machine
- **GitHub account** for repository hosting

### Development Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fullera8/Training_Bank.git
   cd Training_Bank
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code dev container:**
   - Open VS Code in the project directory
   - When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"
   - Or use Command Palette: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # Start both backend and frontend services
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   - **Frontend:** [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
   - **Backend API:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Architecture Overview

### Backend
.NET 8 MVC application with ASP.NET Core and Kestrel web server. Uses multi-stage Docker builds for optimized production images and includes automated MSTest unit testing.

**Key Technologies:** .NET 8, ASP.NET Core MVC, Kestrel, Docker, MSTest, GHCR

### Frontend
Angular application with Node.js 20 LTS, fully containerized with hot reload support. Communicates with backend through Docker Compose networking.

**Key Technologies:** Angular (latest), Node.js 20, npm, Docker, ng serve, GHCR

### Container Orchestration
Leverages GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for cloud-native deployments. Uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) for secure GitHub Actions authentication.

**Key Technologies:** GitHub Actions, GHCR, AKS, OIDC, Kubernetes, Multi-architecture builds

### Development Environment
VS Code dev containers with all required tools pre-installed: Git, Node.js, .NET SDK, Azure CLI, Docker CLI, GitHub CLI, kubectl, and Helm.

**Key Technologies:** VS Code, Dev Containers, Docker, Cloudflare Tunnel, Multi-tool integration

## AI-Enhanced Documentation

This project's documentation includes specialized metadata fields designed for advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-end coding and reasoning capabilities, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 4, or o4-mini High.

**Purpose of Metadata Fields:**
- **Structured Context:** The `[METADATA]`, `[LLM_CONTEXT]`, and similar annotations provide LLMs with deeper, structured understanding of technical concepts, debugging workflows, and architectural decisions
- **Enhanced Assistance:** This structured approach enables AI models to provide more effective, context-aware assistance to developers working with the codebase
- **AI-Driven Development:** The metadata supports advanced AI-assisted development workflows, including automated code generation, debugging assistance, and architectural guidance

**Target Audience:** These enhancements are specifically designed for developers using cutting-edge AI coding assistants and automated development tools.
